                The concept is always based on the customer request, specifics
                of the plot and environment. In our approach to project
                development, we try and enhance the feeling of interaction with
                the shape and light, which exert a secret, but deep influence on
                the level of sensations our clients experience every minute they
                stay in the space. That is why each project is an open

                Architecture is the basis for design, which remains for many
                years and is inherited. For this reason, in designing, we always
                carefully and neatly recheck many times and test all our
                audacious ideas that we generate for each project.
